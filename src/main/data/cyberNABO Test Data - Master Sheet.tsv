It figures in sagas as the home of "Killer Skuta", an early chieftain, and historically was one of two parish church centers in the Myvatn area and has remained one of the most prosperous farms down to modern times. In 2007 Dr. Arni Einarsson of the nearby Myvatn Science Center noticed animal bones and charcoal eroding from previously unsuspected midden deposits south of the present farm dwellings. Follow up work by collaborating FSI and NABO teams (led by Orri Vesteinsson, Agusta Edwald, Tom McGovern, George Hambrecht, Ian Simpson and Astrid Ogilive) in 2007 and 2008 has revealed a deeply stratified set of midden deposits with excellent organic preservation. Test trenches in 2008 have allowed for collection of ecofacts and artefacts datable by a combination of tephra and AMS C14 from first settlement (cultural deposits are directly upon the AD 871+/-2 Landnam tephra) down to the late 19th c. Analysis is still in preliminary stages and a much larger excavation is planned for 2009-10, but initial results suggest some significant changes in economy through time, including a surprisingly substantial amount of seal bones deposited post-1477 (Skutustadir is about 60 km from the sea).

PMS		2002	2002		Mývatn				Steinbogi			Iceland	65.595157	-17.177179		Fornleifastofnun Íslands			sheep house, agricultural building - ovine, sheep, cow, grave-goods, skeleton	2	http://www.nabohome.org/cgi-bin/explore.pl?seq=59	The site Steinbogi in Mývatnssveit was threatened by imminent roadworks and therefore the archaeological potential of the endangered parts of it had to be assessed. The site was also considered of possible value for the Landscape of settlements project and in relation to that additional midden trenching was carried out.

The site of Sveigakot was first surveyed in 1998 in an area now completely eroded. Only midden traces were visible on the surface. It soon became clear that the site could be dated to the Viking Age and was therefore ideal for a comparative study with the larger Hofstaðir project, not least in order to compare the faunal collections from each site.							
PMS		2006	2015		Mývatn				Icelandic Freshwater Radiocarbon Reservoir Effects			Iceland	65.60671	-16.98624		Philippa Ascough			landscape	1	http://www.nabohome.org/cgi-bin/explore.pl?seq=135	The radiocarbon levels in carbon from freshwater systems of lakes and rivers can be lower than in carbon from the terrestrial biosphere. This makes freshwater carbon appear anomalously old when it is radiocarbon dated. In Iceland, freshwater systems are frequently affected by a Freshwater 14C reservoir effect, or FRE, due to inputs of ancient carbon from geothermal systems, and can appear several thousand years older than equivalent terrestrial samples. These FREs affect not only freshwater biota such as fish, but also organisms that consumed freshwater resources, such as pigs and humans.    The present project centres on Myvanssveit, in the northern interior highlands of Iceland, where a large FRE has been identified in Lake Myvatn. The Norse inhabitants of the region relied upon a resource based that included freshwater resources, and consequently bone collagen from humans and pigs within the region may be affected by a FRE.    The ongoing project aims to characterise and quantify the FRE within this region, and explore its impact upon 14C dating of Norse communities.

In front of it, a channel has been cleared for over 20m along the foreshore and intertidal areas.        On visiting the site 20/1/13, the described structure was located at the head of the banks. The channel on the foreshore was not located, possibly masked by rock thrown up by recent storms.    Internal facing stones were visible beneath the thick vegetation cover at one point. This is unusual as noosts as generally less well built, suggesting this may have been a building rather than a noost at some point in its history.

These extend for 45m or more along the coast, beneath a 0.4m covering of blown sand and topsoil. The deposits include fragments of drystone walling, probable floor surfaces and stone features, in association with various anthropogenic soil deposits. To either side of this main exposure there are deep ploughsoil deposits visible in section. Chance finds have included a Neolithic mace head and flint flakes. A programme of survey work carried out in 1992 established that the settlement extended inland for approximately 16m. The erosion face was also recorded at this time. A second, late Neolithic, settlement was identified in the field behind and fieldwalking here in 1995 recovered a quantity of artifacts, including worked flint and a fragment of a polished stone axe. The site continues to be eroded by the sea and has been further damaged by rabbits and nesting fulmars.

This may have been built on the foundations of an earlier chapel. One local tradition suggests that it may have been a private chapel of the Sinclairs of Stove, dating to early 17th C.

Approximately oval in shape, it measures 30m by 25m and stands to 1m high. Some stone protrudes from the surface of the mound and there are several other concentrations protruding through the turf in the immediate area. The mound has been provisionally interpreted as a settlement mound in the past, but the prominent location and discrete nature of the remains may alternatively be taken as evidence of a burial monument.

On average, they measure 1.5m in diameter and are 0.5m deep. In the nearby cliff section, saprolitic deposits are exposed to an overall depth of 2.5m. The hinterland in this area, which is uneven disturbed in appearance, may have been quarried to obtain marl for agricultural purposes. The deposits include very plastic clays, which would be suitable for the production of ceramics.

The section extends for 6m and is up to 0.4m deep. A 0.2m thick layer of buried soil separates the stone from a thin band of drift and the bedrock which lies below it. The stone is discretely packed and, while no structural features can be seen, it does not appear to be of natural origin. There is a slight rise in the immediate hinterland, which may mark further, associated buried remains; this is difficult to determine, however, since the vegetation in this area is hummocky and uneven.							
Sanday					Lamba Ness			Mounds: alleged site of chapel				Scotland / Faroe Islands	59.22656648	-2.678397259					community places		http://www.scharp.co.uk/sites-at-risk/6762/	An area of disturbed ground close to the coast edge has been alleged to be the site of an ancient chapel. Topographically, the site is visible as two conjoined amorphous mounds, separated by a slightly dished hollow; the whole covering an area some 15m long and 7m wide. It is not improbable that these remains represent a rectangular structure, such as a chapel, but this cannot be conclusively determined on present evidence. According to local tradition, a pit, covered by a large flagstone, was once uncovered and then reburied in this area.

Here, at low tide, a body of water is almost completely encircled by stony reefs. It is not clear whether or not this is a natural feature but it shares similarities to fish traps seen elsewhere and may at least be a natural feature which has been enhanced through clearing or deepening the central pool. The enclosed area measures some 60m in length by 30m in width.

This site has been investigated over several seasons up to 1988. Interim results indicate that the earliest remains on the site date back to the Neolithic period; later Iron Age/Pictish remains, followed by Norse period structures well represented later on in the sequence. A large number of artifacts, including a Pictish symbol stone, were recovered during excavation and extensive palaeoenvironmental studies were undertaken. Deposits exposed in the section, which are up to 4m thick, include extensive deposits of midden material, structural remains and cultivation soils. The tell-like accumulation of deposits at this site shares similarities with what is currently known of several of the other 'farm mound' sites on Sanday, which may also be found to represent multiperiod settlements of very long duration.

The 12m long coastal exposure reveals a cairn, comprising a concentration of beach stone, uprights and coursed walling. To the centre of the section, a block of walling, made up of larger stones appears to be part of a small chamber or cist structure. Other structural features include a large upright slab which protrudes from the north end of the cairn and an associated 2.2m long fragment of coursed masonry. The cairn lies over an OGS, which covers a thin deposit of till over bedrock. The cairn, although badly damaged in parts, extends inland for a further 12m. It remains very vulnerable to further erosion. Ref.: RCAHMS (1980), #13.        21/04/2014        As described. Arrangement of stone suggests internal structure. No cultural material visible in deposits suggesting a burial cairn rather than habitation or settlement remains.     Low mound behind coastal section with occasional stone protruding from turf.

It measures 4m in diameter and 1m high. Archaeological deposits are revealed in an exposure along its seaward side, caused by coastal erosion. These comprise structural remains, including a probable flagged floor, and layers of anthropogenic and probable cultivation soils, up to 1m in thickness. The anthropogenic soils, which are best seen to the north side of the mound, contain inclusions of bone, shell, peatash, pot and flint. Further intermittent exposures of anthropogenic soils extend for some 50m to the north. An OGS, which lies below these layers, is exposed in plan at the south side of a stony bay. Some small fragments of flint were noted in this surface.

The beacon was topped by a large ashlar ball, later reused on the beacon at Dennis Head, North Ronaldsay. In 1806, it was fitted with the first revolving light in Scotland. Rebuilt in 1870, the 21m high brick tower was later painted in striking vertical stripes of black and white. It went to automatic in 1962 and is now a listed building. The original two-storied keepers cottages survive and are currently under renovation. To the south side of the lighthouse complex, a farmstead, of traditional design and construction, which incorporates a corn-drying kiln (surveyed) is now ruinous.

(ii) On the coast, archaeological deposits have been exposed in section by coastal erosion. The erosion face extends for 16m and is up to 1.3m deep. A concentration of horizontally-set slabs towards the base of the section, which cover an OGS, may represent a surface. To the north of this, fragments of a structure are associated with an anthropogenic soil, containing charcoal and peatash. Further north again, a probable heath setting is exposed in section; the soil deposits contain inclusions of peatash and burnt bone.        21/04/2014    Dry stone structural remains extend over a 20m stretch of coast edge.    These comprise from the north: a mound or bank with a stone core, possibly a section through a wall; a stretch of concentrated stone, mush of it horizontally laid, possible representing further walling; and what appears to be a rectangular cut possibly lined and filled with stone with evidence of in situ burning. The burnt area also contains frequent nodules of iron. Iron pan was observed in other parts of the section, so this could be naturally precipitated iron pan. However, the concentration in the burnt area could indicate it is is metal working debris.

On the landward side, one bank extends for some 70m, from the east to west across the headland. It stands up to 0.5m high and has spread to 2m in width. The middle part of this bank is more mounded in appearance, standing to 1.5m high and spreading to 7m in width. At the west side of the promontory, a 10m by 13m rectangular area is defined by low banks. Two further large banks (up to 2.5m wide and 0.75m high) form parallel rectangular enclosures which back on to the coast edge. In summary, the earthworks appear to represent a complex comprising a rectangular building and two field enclosures, the whole being defended by a stout bank. It shares little in common with typical prehistoric promontory forts and may be of later date. Ref.: RCAHMS (1980), #57.

The erosion face extends for some 60m in length and is up to 3m in height. Fragmentary walling, revealed in the section, appears to be part of a rectilinear structure, which is aligned parallel to the present erosion face. There is also a wall butt which protrudes from the section at a right angle. The structure(s) stands over an OGS, which covers till and bedrock. A stony destruction horizon, forms the upper level of the section. This, in turn, is covered by ploughsoil, up to 1m deep. At the east end of the section interleaving layers of anthropogenic soils, containing shell, bone and peatash appear to represent domestic midden deposits associated with the structures. The site is vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.

Recent assessment has indicated that the mounds are of prehistoric date, although a disturbed boat-shaped setting was found which may be part of a Viking burial setting. The southernmost mound (HY64SE18) is 30m in diameter. It is prominently located on a natural rise, has a conical shape and lies within 10m of the coast. The surface is pitted and stony. A low grass-covered bank runs off for some 10m from the east side of the mound. A second mound (HY64SW30,'B'), 10m in diameter and lies c.45m to the northeast. The surface is uneven and stony with what may be part of a structural feature. The third mound (HY64SW18, 'A') lies to the north, is oval in shape and measures 13m by 11m.

Measuring 2m long by 1.5m wide, they are now disused and overgrown. A coastal exposure which extends for c.35m from the south side of the noosts contains a concentration of stone which may be part of a surface or wall, possibly associated with fish or kelp drying. An OGS is also exposed in this section. Ref.: RCAHMS (1980), #227.

It measures some 23m in diameter and stands up to 3.5m high, forming a prominent feature on the otherwise flat landscape of Start Island. It was opened and used for a time as a potato store but has now been closed up again. It was last entered in the 1960's by Mr. Skea of Garbo, Sanday, who reported to Henshall that it contained a passage leading to a tall, rectangular chamber with oversailing walls and an intact roof; no side cells were noted. Much of the mound is now covered with turf but there are a number of exposures, particularly to south and south-west sides. Here traces of a wall face and stony mound matrix are visible, together with a stone-filled depression, representing part of the original passage. It was noted that, where visible, the stone forming both walls and mound matrix is in a extremely poor and crumbling condition. Note: Site is incorrectly referred to in NMRS & elsewhere as Mt. Maestry or Mt. Misery. Refs.: RCAHMS (1946) #445; Skea map; Skea name-list; Henshall, A S (1963)#ORK38; RCAHMS (1980) #2.

These were investigated and recorded in 1993. One of the burials was radiocarbon dated to the later Iron Age/Pictish period. Two pyre settings and another cairn covering cists and structural features was recorded during a later season of work in 1997. The cist and structural fragments remains visible in the erosion face, which extends for 50m. A geophysical survey of the area indicated that further remains may extend up to 100m southward of the coast edge.

It appears to have been originally circular or sub-circular and about 25m in diameter. The mound is prominently sited on a natural knoll, on a short headland. It extends, beneath a drystone wall, into a cultivated field and has been truncated by ploughing. On the seaward side, the erosion face is uneven and overgrown but sections of walling and part of a probable passage are visible. The passage is about 1m wide; its walls stand up to 0.4m high and can be traced into the mound for 1.6m. Ref.: RCAHMS (1980), #4.

It is locally said to be dedicated to St. Colm. The line of the building is now barely visible; it appears as a shallow depression and among heaped rubble and storm beach debris, among which occasional lengths of coursed masonry can be seen. It would appear that part of the structure has been crudely rebuilt in the recent past; but this masonry has also now collapsed. Ref.: RCAHMS (1946), #156; RCAHMS (1980), #182.

The square crues have sides measuring 5m; the walls are now reduced to 0.25m or less. The rough buildings, possibly kelp-workers huts, are very fragmentary, being indicated only by the presence of a few upright blocks. Ref.: RCAHMS (1980), #199.        CP- As described, I would not attempt any further interpretation on the basis of the fragmentary remains.

It measures 30m in diameter and is up to 1.5m high. Sea erosion in front of the mound has exposed archaeological deposits in a 25m long section. To the west side, these include a band of highly organic soil, covering shell midden, which is predominantly cockle. To the east side, occasional large stones and a block of coursed masonry protrude from the section. The block of masonry is faced on one side, extends for 1m and stands to 0.5m or 6 courses in height. The stones lie over a very distinctive, highly organic silty soil layer which is up to 0.35m deep. The site was previously recorded as a broch, on the tenuous evidence that it had been included as such on Petrie's list. Cartloads of stone are said to have been removed from the site, but there is no record of what, if anything, was uncovered during these investigations.

In the erosion face, archaeological deposits are exposed for over 25m in section which stands no more than 2m high. These comprise mainly of layers of dirty sand, probably part of an old ground surface, which are up to 0.4m thick. This 'surface' covers a band of shell midden, up to 0.2m thick, which in turn covers till. There are occasional larger stones visible in the section, but the area is too overgrown to determine if these may constitute structural remains. Ref.: RCAHMS (1980), #97.

Aligned north-south, it measures 20m in length by 10m in width and stands up to 1.5m high. There are some earthfast stones visible towards its summit. There are large quantities of blown sand in the near vicinity and it is possible that this feature may be entirely natural or that it may be very much exaggerated in size by the drifting sand.

For the most part, these deposits appear to be natural and to derive from an old storm beach which has been covered and later re-exposed. In one area, however, there are several stones which, being larger in size and apparently horizontally set, may be part of a structure. There are no anthropogenic soils visibly associated. This concentration extends for 5m and stands up to 0.8m high. The coast is being very actively eroded in this area and further exposures may provide more substantial evidence of the nature of this site.

The boat, which had been set in a stone-lined cut, contained the remains of a man, woman and a child, together with a rich array of grave goods. This pagan burial is thought to date from between the last quater of the ninth century and the middle of the tenth century. The results of excavation are published in full (Owen & Dalland). There is now nothing to see of the burial site. Nearby, a small mound is being eroded; part of a drystone wall is revealed in the exposure.

The wall curves from the east side of Start Island and turns northward to enclose a basin which measures some 25m across at its widest point. The northern end of the wall is obscured by a vehicle track. It is edged by a discontinuous kerb of upright slabs and is of rough construction. This structure was probably originally larger than it now appears and may have utilised a natural shingle bank, which lies to its northern edge, to form a fully enclosed basin.

It measures approximately 5.5m by 5m and has a sunken floor. Immediately adjacent to this there is an overgrown, hollowed area, which may either be part of a sunken structure or possibly a working yard. This measures 7m by 6m. A stone-revetted bank stands to the landward side of the structures, extending for 9m and standing to 0.45m high. At the east end of the bank a concentration of loose stone, 20m in diameter, may be the remains of a working platform. There are numerous overgrown kelp pits and drying walls in the area.

The surface of the mound is uneven and there are several upright stones protruding from the turf. Overall, it measures approximately 25m by 18m and stands up to 1m in height. Up to 5% of the surface of the mound shows signs of rabbit burrowing. At the west end of the mound a boat-shaped depression is cut into the surface. Measuring 6m in length by 2m wide, this possible noost is 0.3m deep and is lined with slabs. A second hollow, which may also be a boat noost, is located on the coast edge nearby.

The erosion face extends for some 40m and is up to 4.5m high. It is overgrown, however, and therefore not very informative on the nature or composition of the mound. Short exposures of masonry and occasional protruding stones are suggestive of an underlying structure. There are some fragments of animal bone among the sandy matrix but there is little in the way of obvious stratigraphy or anthropogenic deposits. A drystone enclosure, built near the top of the mound and of much later date, is now collapsing down the seaward side. Ref.: RCAHMS (1980), #160.

The byres have slab partitions. The farm is now abandoned and the buildings are in a state of disrepair. Some fragments of the original flagstone roofs survive, but the buildings are mostly roofless. The coast edge in front of the farm has been eroded by the sea and substantial deposits of organic soil layers are exposed for over 100m. These are up to 0.8m thick and contain inclusions of peatash, shell, mammal and fish bone and charcoal. It is unclear if these deposits are directly related to the last farmstead on the site or if they predate it; it is probable, however, that they represent settlement over an extended period of time.

There is now nothing to be seen and it has been speculated by previous surveyors that any remains in the area may more likely be associated with a nearby post-broch settlement. The site was not inspected on this occasion because access was denied by the landowner.

The current erosion face is cut through the highest point of the mound, exposing up to 5m of archaeological deposits in a 150m long section. The surviving portion of the mound slopes inland from the section face and is visible for some 60m. The exposed deposits are a well-stratified mix of organic soils with frequent inclusions of shell (limpet, cockle, winkle), bone, peatash and charcoal. In the section, a fragment of masonry, 1.2m long by 0.3m high, has the appearance of an outer wall face belonging to a structure only now beginning to erode. Of note, is the survival of fibrous organic material, which occurs in discrete lenses, and which appears to be a mixture of straw and dung; probably byre waste. In the scale and appearance of the mound and in the nature of the exposed deposits, this mound appears to be fairly typical of the Sanday farm mounds, but there are some indications that it may have early origins. Fragments of straight sided pottery, possibly of Bronze Age date, were recovered from deposits towards the base of the section. The remains are known to have been eroding since at least 1928; they are very vulnerable to further coastal erosion and the section is inherently unstable, being based on soft sand deposits. Ref.: RCAHMS (1946), #174; RCAHMS (1980), #81.

It is aligned end-on to the beach and measures 11m long by 5m wide. The building has crow-stepped gables and retains fragments of a slate roof. The walls are clay-bonded and traces of render survive both internally and externally. Fireplaces are built into both of the end walls on the upper story; that at the west end retains a fine sandstone surround. There are windows in both the side and west end walls on the upper level, while there are two opposed doorways and two window at ground level. A shed, 4m by 5m, adjoins the west end wall.

Previously, only the largest of these mounds (A) was noted. Records indicate that a ceramic urn was recovered from a mound in this area; there are now no indications of which, if any, of these mounds may have been the subject of this investigation. The urn has since been lost. The largest mound (A), is built on a natural ridge. It measures 18m in diameter and stands up to 1.75m high. It has been badly denuded by cattle poaching and upwards of 50% of the surface is bare. As the highest point, in an otherwise relatively flat field, it provides a vantage point for the cattle and is therefore vulnerable to continued erosion. Some 100m to the north of (A), lies mound (B). This measures 10m in diameter and 1m in height and has been rounded and reduced through cultivation. In the corner of the field, approximately 100m to the northeast of (B) is a third mound, (C). Measuring 8m in diameter and 1m in height, this mound has been partially denuded by cattle poaching. A possible fourth mound (D) lies 25m to the north side of (C). It is covered with grass and measures 8m in diameter nd 0.5m in height. A wall runs over its summit.

Sanday		-1000	1000		Colli Ness			Probable broch, chapel & cemetery				Scotland / Faroe Islands	59.26442278	-2.554262435					grave-goods, community places, cemetary		http://www.scharp.co.uk/sites-at-risk/6823/	A prominent natural rise located at the neck of a promontory is further enlarged by an artificial mound. The site has been recorded as a chapel, burial ground and possible broch. Archaeological remains are known to have been disturbed in this area by military activity, prior to 1928. Records mention the discovery of a possible cup and ring marked stone, a possible cross slab fragment, a chapel and probable early christian cemetery and beneath it, the remains of a probable broch. The only structure now visible is a military building of 20th C date, which serves as an occasional store and cattle shelter. This building measures 8m by 3m, has a concrete roof and a doorway at either end. Interestingly, while the majority of the structure is built from mortared beach stone, several blocks of hand-dressed red sandstone have been incorporated into the walls near the doorways. These may derive from the church which previously stood on this site. This building has been built over part of an earlier enclosure wall, which extends around the summit of the mound. Enclosing an area of 25m by 18m, this drystone wall incorporates dressed stone blocks which may also derive from the chapel. In places, the wall runs slightly irregularly and is thicker; this may be because it has accommodated and incorporated pre-existing structures. At the northwest side of the mound, the collapse of part of the enclosure wall has revealed early structural remains beneath it. Below the present ground level is exposed what looks like part of a cell constructed within a thick wall. The exposed portion of this 'cell' measures 3m in length and 1.25m wide; the batter of the walls suggest that it had a corbelled roof. The best provisional interpretation of this feature is that it represents an intra-mural cell within a broch wall. If this is the case, it is possible that a great deal more archaeological remains are present that was previously though to be the case.

One lies on the coast edge and is actively eroding; burnt stone is visible in several exposures towards the base of the mound. It measures 10m by 5m and is 1.7m high. A second mound lies further inland, in a field of improved grazing. This measures 10m by 8m and stands to 1.3m high. It is fully covered with vegetation and there are no signs of burnt stone.

It has been truncated by cultivation and now measures some 60m in diameter and 2m high. There are no exposures in the surface of the mound and it is covered with tall vegetation. The scale and location of this mound may indicate that it is not entirely natural; it may cover farm or settlement remains.

Antiquarian investigations carried out in 1880 were briefly reported by Cursiter; at this time the structure had already been damaged by erosion and it was then estimated that up to 50% had been removed. The broch is estimated to have measured between 15m and 18m in diameter, with walls up to 3.96m thick. Remains are now visible in a coastal exposure some 80m in length and up to 1m in height. The upper part of the coastal section is covered by overhanging turf, while the base is obscured by a storm beach. The visible archaeology comprises both structural stone and substantial anthropogenic deposits. The inland extent of the remains was not inspected because access was denied by the landowner. A modern marker cairn has been built at the head of the banks, above the broch remains.

The removal of further deposits from around the cist now indicate that it is surrounded by anthropogenic soils, probably within a kerbed mound. One side of the cist box, formed from a single slab (70mm x 30mm x 7mm) protrudes from the section face. The remainder of the cist has been removed by erosion, leaving a void. From the size of the projecting slab and the size of the void it can be estimated that the cist measured in the region of 0.55m in width by 0.79m in length. To the west side of the cist, a group of flat slabs extend outwards for 2m, covering a layer of ashy, organic soil which constitutes the basal deposits of the mound. A small fragment of unworked flint was noted in the ashy soil deposits. To the east side of the cist, peatash lenses extend outwards for 4m to abut large stone blocks. These blocks appear to mark the limit of the site and may form an external kerb. The ashy layers are interspersed with lenses of redeposited till and bands of charcoal rich soil. The surface of the underlying till in this area is reddened, apparently due to episodes of burning. There is no sign of a mound in the hinterland. The site is very vulnerable to continued erosion by the sea.

The long axis of the mound runs parallel with the coast; it extends for over 70m and is up to 50m wide. At its highest point, the mound stands to 3.75m above the level of the storm beach. Inland, it extends into a pasture field and is very overgrown. A drystone wall runs along its length. At the highest point of the mound, a curving earthwork may be part of a enclosure; it appears too wide to be part of a broch wall. The erosion face has slumped and is overgrown, but there are intermittent exposures in which archaeological deposits can be seen. These occur mostly towards the base of the section and appear to continue below the level of the present beach. Exposed deposits include layers of very organic soils, some with inclusions of animal bone and shell, and possible fragmentary structures. Previous records mention a stone-lined well of the type often found in association with brochs; this is no longer in evidence. Ref.: RCAHMS (1946), #460; RCAHMS (1980), #181.        CP- Site is as described above, although what is thought to be the well was located. Local tradition stated that the well was dangerous and had been infilled with debris such as old fence wire. A deep, drystone lined circular shaft was located on the seaward side of the modern wall. This was obscured by rolls of rusty fencing wire and is most likely the well referred to. I could see no obvious evidence of a chapel but the mound is a classic Orkney broch mound. The erosion face is relatively stable, with only the lower part affected in places.

It extends inland for some 50m and runs parallel with the coast for 25m. In addition to coastal erosion, the mound has also been damaged by cattle poaching and is denuded of vegetation in places. The erosion face is sloping and overgrown, making it difficult to gain an overview of the archaeological deposits present. These include various layers of sandy loam and highly organic brown-black soil, peatash-rich soils and deposits containing frequent shell, fish and mammal bone and charcoal. There are also concentrations of stone present which may be part of or derive from structures. It is impossible to gauge the condition, date or importance of the remains from what is currently visible, but it is probable that they represent a settlement or farm mound. Previous records mention frequent finds of flint in the area. To the east side of the mound, cultivated soils up to 0.4m deep are exposed in section.

It lies over 100m from the coast edge and has been surveyed by RCAHMS. The jetty is now largely destroyed and is visible only as a group of intermittent edge-set stones on the lower foreshore. It can be traced for some 20m extending into the sea and is estimated to have measured between 1.75m and 2m in width.

While no signs of artificial construction are immediately apparent, it is possible that the pool has been widened and deepened to act as a fish trap. Its location off a small headland, to the west side of the Bay of Sandquoy, appears suitable for such a trap. It measures approximately 50m by 30m.

These are situated behind the coast edge in an area of active dune movement. On the coast edge, coursed masonry (1.8m long x 0.6m high) is exposed in section, sandwiched between layers of blown sand. It is probable that the walling is part of a feature which was associated with the farmstead and that it has only recently been buried by blown sand.

The present house and garden (rough grassland) of Sandquoy are located partially on the mound. The coastal side of the mound is currently stable and grassed, but old erosion faces and sections of stone walling can be seen intermittently through the establishing turf at a height. The erosion faces comprise possible midden deposits overlying subsoil.        Previous records describe how a structure was discovered here and demolished sometime prior to 1928. According to a local informant at that time, the structure comprised three compartments in which three human skulls and shell and bone midden were found. On the basis of this, the site has been classed as a possible souterrain or house, although it would be unusual to find human remains in such a context. It is possible, therefore, that the structure was in reality a burial monument such as a small chambered cairn or a complex triple cist arrangement. Now the only remains of any archaeological potential visible in the area comprise concentrations of stones, which are visible in the coastal erosion face. No trace was seen of the midden deposits recorded previously. Ref.: RCAHMS (1946), #440; RCAHMS (1980), #87.

At the coast edge, the peripheries of the mound have been eroded by the sea and archaeological deposits are exposed in the section. Given their location in relation to the mound as a whole, it should be noted that these deposits may not be generally representative. They include substantial layers of highly organic soil, up to 2m deep, and soils containing frequent bone, shell (limpet and winkle, particularly) and peatash inclusions. Several flint fragments were noted. Concentrations of stone, which may be structural, are exposed but cannot be readily interpreted because the section face has slumped and is uneven. The erosion face extends for some 20m along the coast. Sherds of brown glaze ceramic, of 19thC date, and fragments of iron occur in the uppermost layers, but there are otherwise no diagnostic artifacts visible in the section. The base of the section is obscured by a storm beach. Ref.: RCAHMS (1980), #92.

It is sub-circular in plan, measures some 50m in diameter and stands to 3m at its highest point. It is unlikely to be an entirely natural formation because, although no archaeological deposits are exposed, it's 'pudding bowl' shape differs markedly from the surrounding dunes. It is probable that, whatever its original form, the mound has been augmented by a covering of wind blown sand. It has been variously identified as a prehistoric site, a broch and a sand dune in the past. Ref.: RCAHMS (1946), #168; RCAHMS (1980), #137.

Within the complex are several larger mounds and groups of smaller mounds which are located in close proximity and which together form chains or enclosures. Previously, it was speculated that the majority of the mounds were likely to be funerary monuments, possibly surrounding larger Maes-Howe type tombs, however, investigations in the 1980's revealed a Bronze Age structural complex, rich midden deposits and buried cultivation soils. The results of this work are awaited and as yet there is very little known for certain about the remains in the wider landscape. Two mounds and two stone concentrations are located on the coast edge and are vulnerable to erosion. Stones protrude from the mounds, possibly indicating the presence of structural remains. The stone concentrations may represent remnant structures which have been damaged by erosion but could alternatively be the ex-situ remains of structures removed from further inland.

It may have served as a signal or gun post, associated with the WWII radar station which lies nearby at Whale Head (SY23, HY74SE23). It measures approximately 4m in length by 3m in width. The walls stand up to 1.4m high and appear to be largely of drystone construction, although there are occasional traces of mortar on the surface of the stones. The single entrance is on the landward side. The roof is now cracked and the structure is vulnerable to coastal erosion.

The remains of at least one drystone structure is exposed. This contains a flagged floor, built over an old ground surface and is covered by a stony destruction horizon and up to 0.5m of blown sand and topsoil. To the south, a 1.5m thick band of deposits comprises structural remains and anthropogenic soils containing shell and bone. The remains would appear to be part of a settlement, possibly of prehistoric or early historic date. A mounded area behind the coast edge may indicate the presence of further archaeological deposits inland. Refs.: Skea name-list; RCAHMS (1980) #80.

Sanday					Park			Coastal exposure: shell midden				Scotland / Faroe Islands	59.28024618	-2.402726671					N/A		http://www.scharp.co.uk/sites-at-risk/6664/	Shell and stone deposits are visible in three short exposures in sand dunes which form the coast edge. The westernmost exposure measures some 10m in length and is located in the upper 1.2m of a dune ridge which stands up to 2.5m in height. Here, a 0.4m deep concentration of stone covers a 0.1m deep layer of crushed shell fragments. The base of the dunes are obscured by accumulations of sand. In a second 10m long exposure, located some 30m further east, a column of coursed masonry is visible, with concentrations of shell lying both above and below it. There is currently nothing to indicate the nature or date of these remains. The easternmost exposure lies 10m further along. Here, part of a wall can be seen to run parallel to the coast edge for some 8m. Formed from flat slabs, this coursed wall stands up to 0.4m high and is covered only by turf and topsoil; a thin band of shelly soil lies beneath it. Further, more fragmentary, remains are visible inland in this area.

Together, the exposures extend for upwards of 10m and are up to 0.75m deep. The basal deposits comprise of a linear concentration of flat slabs, laid over an old ground surface; the upper levels include anthropogenic columns of collapsing masonry and soils containing shell and bone. These are buried beneath layers of blown sand, topsoil and turf up to 0.3m deep. Part of the section is obscured by modern rubble, while the base of the section is covered by a storm beach.							
Sanday					Lopness			Coastal exposure & mound				Scotland / Faroe Islands	59.28267929	-2.428202202					skeleton		http://www.scharp.co.uk/sites-at-risk/6678/	Anthropogenic soils are exposed in a 2m high coastal exposure which extends for 15m. These deposits are covered with layers of blown sand, 1m in depth. The upper levels include a buried A horizon, up to 0.5m thick, covering a 0.2m layer of highly organic soil which contains inclusions of bird, fish and mammal bone, shell and small fragments of flint. Beneath, a layer of shell, mostly comprising limpet, covers an old ground surface. An amorphous rise, located in the immediate hinterland, may be a farm mound and it is probable that the deposits seen in section may be derived from this source.

The superstructure has now been largely removed and the hulk rests in shallow water some 20m from the foreshore, with framework, turbines and boilers exposed. Ref.: RCAHMS (1980) #221.        The wreck is only clear of the sea on the beach at the lowest of tides. It is ordinarily submerged partially or completely.							
Sanday		900	1300		Bay of Lopness/Newark Settlement Mound			Coastal exposure, mounds, (?) fish trap				Scotland / Faroe Islands	59.26838699	-2.48585935					skeleton, community places		http://www.scharp.co.uk/sites-at-risk/6681/	Substantial archaeological deposits are exposed in an extensive erosion face to the seaward side of a large mound. The exposure measures some 50m in length overall, with the central 15m containing the greatest depth of deposits. The visible archaeological deposits are up to 1m thick and may be even more extensive since the base of the section is obscured by drifts of windblown sand. In the main, the deposits comprise successive layers of anthropogenic soils with inclusions of shell, charcoal, fish and mammal bone. One very distinctive layer contains frequent fish bone which was seen to include a number of entire articulated skeletons. The rocky intertidal area in front of the section face, Long Taing of Newark, has several linear concentrations of stone which appear to have been artificially set in place, possibly to form a fish trap. One possible interpretation may be that fish-processing was carried out at this site and that it was associated with the nearby settlement at Newark (SY35), which appears to be of Viking/Norse date.        ShoreUPDATE 9th Feb 2014:    The site has been affected by coastal erosion over the last 2 months. Less than half of the mound now survives. Structures are now visible as follows:        From S-N from modern drain outlet;    1. Two parallel walls built at modern beach level, cross sectioned by erosion (photo 3). This is S of main midden deposits.    2. N of parallel walls and main midden deposits, apparently separated from it by band of sand - a series of drystone walls, unclear if circular/rectilinear, but one distinct dog-leg is clear (photos 4,5,11). These structures are at modern beach level.    3. Rectilinear structures? Norse type - two are visible, one overlying the above-described drystone walls and at least one to the N of this (photos 11,15,16,17). These structures are c.1m above current beach level, seemingly built on windblown sand.        This site relates to NMRS sites 306538 AND 313943							
Sanday		900	1300		Newark			Mound & coastal exposure				Scotland / Faroe Islands	59.26729369	-2.487650567					skeleton, community places, farm		http://www.scharp.co.uk/sites-at-risk/6682/	An large 'farm mound' which is located immediately by the coast edge, has been eroded in places by the sea to reveal substantial structural remains. The mound measures some 50m in diameter and stands up to 3m high. Archaeological deposits are visible in the erosion face for over 120m, but the most substantial deposits are contained within a 15m long section to the south of the area. Here, fragments of coursed drystone walling stands up to 0.75m or 8 courses high; two stone-lined drains are also present. The walling runs parallel to the section face and appears to represent part of a rectangular structure which was built on sloping ground, to one side of a midden heap. The soils which lie beneath the base of the wall are highly organic and contain inclusions of shell, bone, peatash and charcoal. Traces of later buildings are suggested by further concentrations of slabs and blocks to the south. Overall, the visible remains indicate that the site was occupied over a long period of time; the exposed structural remains may be of Viking/Norse date.

The erosion face extends for 25m in length and is up to 0.75m high. It can be seen concentrations of horizontally-coursed slabs and an associated loamy soil which contains inclusions of shell. This walling may be no more than an earlier version of the dyke which now runs along the coast edge but it remains possible that it may be part of a larger structure, the rest of which lies beneath the mound.

The seaward side of the mound is eroding and archaeological deposits are visible intermittently over a distance of some 40m. The deposits include a number of large edge-set slabs and large blocks which appear to represent part of at leat one structure. Associated soils include highly organic deposits containing mammal and fishbone, charcoal and shell midden, comprised mainly of limpet and winkle. There are further mounded areas present in the immediate hinterland and it is probable that they also represent buried archaeological remains. As has been stated by previous surveyors, this is likely to be an extensive settlement site, probably of prehistoric date. Ref.: RCAHMS (1980) #86.

It is sub-oval in shape, measuring some 25m by 12m and stands no more than 1m high. A modern marker cairn has been constructed on its highest point. The seaward side of the mound has been damaged by coastal erosion and stonework, which appears to be of a structural nature, is exposed in an erosion face which extends for 10m and is up to 1m high. This area is used by nesting fulmars. To the north side of the mound can be seen the feint outline of a curvilinear earthwork. This is up to 2m in width and extends for 15m or more inland, running to the west of the mound. The Ref.: Orkney Name Book No.2, 1879; RCAHMS (1946) #446; RCAHMS (1980) #156.

Limited rescue investigation was carried out in 1983 and indicated that up to three structural phases may be present. The earliest phase, represented by a stalled cairn was later replaced with a circular structure and a rounded mound. The chamber of the stalled cairn, which is partially exposed in the coastal section, extended for at least 9m in length and was up to 1.4m wide. Fragmentary remains of a later circular structure were found at the southern end of the primary chamber. The rounded mound, which forms the latest and most prominent feature of the site, measures about 14m in diameter and stands up to 1.3m high. The site remains very vulnerable to coastal erosion.

It surmounts a natural knoll, set within a marshy area between a small loch and the sea. Partial antiquarian investigations were carried out in the late 1800's, probably by Farrar, and the site was briefly noted by both Petrie and later by Dryden. The mound and surrounding platform, which are very overgrown, cover an area some 80m in diameter. Little of the actual broch structure is now visible, although some stonework is exposed to the north side of the mound. The scale of the mound strongly suggests the presence of extra-broch settlement; there are also indications of an surrounding enclosure bank. It should be noted that the waterlogged conditions in the local area may have important implications for the survival of organic materials within the archaeological deposits.

It is up to 40m in diameter and stands 1.5m or so in height. The seaward side of the mound is being eroded by the sea and archaeological deposits, probably derived from settlement, are exposed in the section. At the west end of the exposure a 1.3m deep deposit of buried soil can bee seen to extend over a distance of 9m. Further east, an old cultivation soil is associated with interleaving ashy lenses; structural remains lie over these deposits and are associated with anthropogenic layers containing peat ash and animal bone. The form of the structure is not readily visible in section but at least one stone-lined feature, possibly a drain, was seen. The section face is being further damaged by nesting fulmars and by rabbit burrowing. Chance finds from the section include fragments of pumice, pottery and small flint chips.

It is aligned north-south and measures 20m by 30m. The bank is 2m in width and stands up to 1m high. It is mostly covered with turf, but occasional stones protrude. It is located 10m from the coast edge and has been damaged by rabbit burrowing. The enclosure appears to have been built over a pre-existing mound: exposures into the mound caused by rabbit burrowing indicate that the upper levels of the mound, at least, comprise of blown sand. The mound stands up to 3m high and is not physically linked to the dunes which form the coast edge in this area. The area is very overgrown with ragwort. In the adjacent intertidal area, a linear bank of shingle, 40m in length, lies parallel to the shore and may have originally enclosed a 20m wide tidal pool or fish trap.

They are of rough build and are now in poor condition. There are also several overgrown kelp-burning pits along the head of the banks in this area. The remains of a rectilinear structure, which may also be associated with kelp working, stands to the rear of the dunes, some 5m from the coast edge. It measures 18m in length and is up to 5m wide. An enclosure, some 15m in diameter and defined by a 1m high bank, lies nearby.

It was investigated by Farrer and Petrie in the 1860's with subsequent salvage excavations carried out by Childe in the 1950's. The cairn measures 20.5m by 17m and stands on an artificial platform. A 9m entrance passage leads into the central chamber. This stands 4m high and has six symmetrically-arranged side cells opening off of it. Sherds of Neolithic pottery, animal bone and stone implements were uncovered, along with a quantity of human remains. The tomb has been consolidated and partially restored and is open to the public under guardianship protection.

The original dimensions are unknown; it is now sub-oval in shape, measuring 8m by 20m. It stands up to 3m high, above bedrock. The eastern side has been severely damaged by the sea; quantities of stony core material are exposed and eroding in the banks and there are occasional hints of structural stone. The western side has been damaged by cattle poaching. There was some suggestion of recent amateur digging within the body of the mound at the time of this visit. This site requires urgent attention; investigation of the remaining portion may at least provide a ground plan, a date, a summary of the stratigraphy and may determine if there was a central chamber.

The remains on the east side are difficult to verify; the area is uneven and overgrown and the most identifiable elements appear to be a series of quarry hollows. On the south side, an erosion face containing archaeological deposits has been exposed by the sea. This section lies to the seaward side of an amorphous mounded area, beneath the modern cemetery enclosure wall. It extends for 5m and is up to 1.5m high. The greater part of the remains comprise of a wall, buried beneath 0.8m of soil, which is up to 7 courses/ 0.9m high and slumped inward. A probable floor surface, formed from closely-fitted flat slabs, extends from the base of the wall on to the foreshore. Anthropogenic soils associated with this contain both burnt and unburnt mammal and fish bone. While the walling may be no more than the remains of an earlier cemetery enclosure, it is more likely to be the remains of an older building, possibly even of medieval date. Ref.: Marwick, H (1923) 'Antiquarian notes on Sanday', POAS, 1 (1922-3), 26-7; RCAHMS (1946) #436; RCAHMS (1980) #79.

The walling is coursed and stands up to 0.5m/5 courses high. Two of the wall fragments, which protrude from the section face at oblique angles, appear to represent the side and end walls of a rectangular structure with the corner already destroyed by the sea. The third fragment of walling protrudes at a right angle from the section and may be part of an internal dividing wall. On this assumption, the building measures at least 20m in length. Floor levels are suggested by successive layers of flat slabs, interspersed with grey clay and fine gravel. Associated soil deposits contain inclusions of animal bone, shell and mortar. The possible date range for this structure ranges from the Norse to post-medieval periods.        Sections of the wall are being washed out. In 2012 4 large magnetite ore lumps found falling out of wall back face. May be boat noust to south.         Outline of rectangular building visible as earthworks above ground. Three patches of stonework visible in the section. The westernmost area is all that remains of the north wall, the rest of the north elevation has been eroded out. The middle and eastern areas of stone possibly represent an internal wall and the east wall. All stand to around 0.5m high and around 5-6 courses are visible, with clay bonding.        CP- site visited with 'Kirkhall' after she found several lumps of magnetite on the foreshore in the general vicinity. More lumps identified on the site. These immediately underlie turf and overlie the uppermost remains of a wall. The landward side of the site was very overgrown and hard to interpret.

It contains well-sorted fragments of shell and bone. There are no structural remains currently visible in association with this soil but in consideration of the fact that it undoubtedly represents cultivation over an extended period, it may be worthwhile to keep this section under surveillance.

It importance as a port has diminished since the construction of a new pier and ferry terminal at Loth at the south end of the island was completed in the 1990's. A number of buildings in the village are noted by RCAHMS. These include the post office (HY63NE21), a substantial two-storied stone storehouse (HY63NE22) and a cottage (HY63NE24). The pier (HY63NE18.00) and slipway (HY63NE23) are listed structures. A capstan (HY63NE18.01) stands to one side of the modern weighbridge, at the foot of the pier.

It stands to 1.5m in height and is 20m in diameter. At the time of inspection, the mound was under crop and it was notable that the vegetation over this area was significantly greener than the surrounding area. This would appear to indicate that the mound comprises, at least in part, of deeper, richer or more water-retentive soils.

The building, which measures some 21m in length by 7m in width, is thought to date to the late 17th or early 18th C. This church is said to have been built on the foundations of a pre-reformation chapel, dedicated to the Holy Cross. A 16th C account mentions an earlier cemetery with outsize skeletons' being uncovered by erosion. Previous surveyors have noted the presence of midden deposits and drystone walling in the coastal section as indicative of an early settlement. It has been suggested that the site may be of prehistoric date and that the location is also a likely one for a high status Norse settlement. The coastal section is protected by a sea wall which has been recently renewed and no eroding deposits were noted on this visit. There is a mounded area which extends from the eastern side of the cemetery which may represent archaeological remains, covered beneath a thick layer of blown sand. The mound measures some 40m in diameter and stands up to 2m high. Earthworks, previously noted at the west side of the cemetery, have been tentatively identified as the remains of an early church enclosure or part of an earlier settlement.

Petrie investigated the remains in 1867 and noted that the main structure was surrounded by a ring of large stones and that the walls had a considerable batter. The site has been badly damaged in the past by deliberate leveling and what remains is now subject to destruction by sea erosion and through small-scale sand extraction. In the coastal section, erosion has exposed midden and fragmentary structural deposits over a distance of some 20m; deep anthropogenic soils extend to the west of this for almost 100m. The structural remains include a 3m thick wall, double faced with a soil and rubble core and fragmentary floor surfaces. The midden deposits contain inclusions of bone, peatash, burnt clay and shell. Traces of an OGS are intermittently visible beneath the structural remains. To the rear of the coast, a grassy mound measuring 20m in diameter and standing up to 1.75m high may mark the presence of further buried deposits.

Subsequent investigations by Lamb recorded a large mound in this vicinity. The mound measured 30m in diameter and stood to 1m in height. It appeared to contain structures and was interpreted as the probable remains of the church. The mound, as described, could not be relocated although it is possible that the site here described as (SY8) at HY7840 4368, while differing in size, may be equivalent.

Described as a broad bank, spread to 8m in width and 0.5m in height, it was last noted in 1981. At that time, it was said to be very confused with stabilised blown sand. It was not seen during this visit and may now be completely obscured by drifting sand.

It is surrounded by several other small, amorphous mounds and sand dunes and the entire area is very overgrown. Occasional fragments of walling are exposed in the coastal section, but there is no sign of substantial masonry or obvious broch features noted by previous surveyors. The mounded area, together with traces of anthropogenic soils exposed in the cliff section suggest that this site represents a settlement of probable prehistoric date, but there is now no indication of a broch. The cliff section is actively eroding. Ref.: RCAHMS (1946), #160; RCAHMS (1980), #62.

It is covered with consolidated deposits of wind blown sand which may hide a stone constituent; occasional stones are visible in rabbit scrapes along its length. It is divided into two parts, with a gap in between. To the eastern side, the barrier measures 27m in length by 19m in width and stands to 3.3m high; the western section is 12m long by 13m wide and has a flattened ledge or 'apron' along its landward side. Previous surveyors have noted midden deposits and stony heaps in this area. It is probable that these remains may be of pre-modern and possibly prehistoric date. A small, rectangular enclosure, defined by a stony bank, lies at the tip of the promontory and appears to be a planticrub of recent date. Ref.: RCAHMS (1946), #171; RCAHMS (1980), 150.

Here and there around the mound, large stones protrude through the turf. Stone is also exposed in the coastal section where sea erosion has made inroads into the mound. Over 60% of the surface area of the mound is affected by rabbit burrowing. A more modern structure is built on top of the mound. This truncated conical construction is built from mortared beach stone. It stands to 2m, measuring 2.5m in diameter at its base and narrows up to 1.1m. The seaward side has begun to collapse. This structure is locally regarded as a windmill base; it has also been recorded as a navigation marker. Ref.: RCAHMS (1980), #9.

The site directors kindly involved the NABO zooarchaeologists (led through various seasons by Tom McGovern and Sophia Perdikaris), and the zooarchaeology team was able to participate directly in the field excavations from 1996 onwards. The modern open area excavation of this major Viking Age hall and its associated buildings offered a unique opportunity for North Atlantic zooarchaeology, allowing comparisons of bone assemblages from fully excavated middens and structures and the combination of horizontal and vertical stratigraphic perspectives on the interpretation of site formation processes. The close cooperation between excavators and specialists continued from fieldwork through post-excavation analysis, and has unquestionably improved the quality of this report							
tdar		2002	2002		Oddastaðir				Midden Investigations at Oddastaðir, Mývatnssveit, N Iceland, 2002			Iceland	65.5	-17					skeleton, community places		http://core.tdar.org/document/3364/midden-investigations-at-oddastair-myvatnssveit-n-iceland-2002	During the 2002 field season of the Landscapes of Settlement Project (directed by Fornleifastofnun ĺslands with collaboration by the NABO cooperative) a team (Tom McGovern and Christian Keller) visited Oddastaðir August 9 th 2002 with the objective of localizing possible midden deposits around the several groups of ruins contained within the surviving home field wall. McGovern made a series of soil cores using the Oakfield tube type soil corer and dug a 1 x 1 m test pit, while Keller carried out a GPS aided survey map of the general area (returning Aug 12-13 th to complete observations). The soil cores rapidly indicated that the most substantial cultural deposits were around the grass covered ruin near the center of the Oddastaðir complex (ruin group F in this report), striking the prehistoric H3 tephra at 126 cm below modern surface with ca 80cm of cultural deposit above. The cores outside ruin complexes H and I to the S turned up ca 10-20 cm of deeply buried cultural materials but no clear indications of midden. The test pit (trench II) reached H3 at 130 cm from modern surface, and held some 80 cm of stratified ash (wood and peat) charcoal, and a few well preserved bone fragments. A profile drawn by Orri picked up a probable 1717 tephra above the heavy 1477, then traces of N 1300, H 1158, and then the LNS above H3 at the base of the profile. While test trench II seems to have missed the bone rich portion of the midden (which is probably a few meters downslope, further from the front wall) it did serve to indicate the long medieval occupation sequence and a shorter early modern presence. The site appears extremely promising for additional excavation work.

The site is endangered by highway construction and is target of a multidisciplinary rescue effort as part of the overall regional research and education effort. The midden team located an extensive midden deposit up to 75-80 cm thick in front of what appears to be the main house mound. A 3 x 3 m midden unit K was begun, and carried through to subsoil in a small 25 cm x 1 m sondage. Significant amounts of well preserved animal bone were collected, along with artifacts suggesting a medieval date for the majority of the deposit (including the games piece illustrated above). The midden is not deposited upon an undisturbed natural surface, but rests on what was probably extensive turf cuttings that have been carried to the surface of the prehistoric H3 tephra. There are no other in situ tephra visible, even the thick 1477 tephra seems to have been removed by later turf cutting. However the surviving midden deposits are quite rich in well preserved bone and artifacts, including a single sided comb fragment roughly dating main context to pre- 1200 AD. The deposit is well worth further investigation and should provide a welcome comparison to later phases of the other Mývatnssveit archaeofauna.

A small farm site now much overgrown with dwarf birch and willow had clear boundary walls, several room depressions in a small farm mound, and a clear mounded midden deposit to the NE of the main structure. A small test pit had been dug some time in the past at the base of the midden mound, but this appears to have missed the main deposit and is mainly sterile. Three cores were placed in a line across the upstanding midden mound, and these demonstrated between 50 and 90 cm of deposit extending down to the distinctive local LNS. Fish bone, ash, charcoal, bird egg shell (in some quantity), and burnt mammal bone suggest that this is both a rich and an early deposit. Logistic problems are considerable however, and supporting or maintaining an excavation crew on site would be a challenge.

In 2009, a larger scale midden excavation was carried out. The trenched midden and especially its underlying structure are remains of the original site settlement, with other structures possibly associated with later site activities mentioned in written sources (Hreiðarsdóttir 2008:233, some information in English in Harrison et al 2010).  Radiocarbon analysis dates the Skuggi midden deposits to ca. AD 970 – 1208; Tephrochronology further aids in dating this site: All midden deposits are sealed by H1300, and most of them by H1407. The turf structure under the midden contains tephra layers deposited during the volcanic landnám eruption (LNS) that coincided with Icelandic settlement in AD 871.  The Skuggi midden excavation, directed by the author was the latest in a series of archaeological projects that are all part of a larger Eyjafjörður Ecodynamics program.

The site was excavated by Þór Magnússon.     1. A boat grave, dug into a sand-dune, covered with soil and a layer of stone, E-W ((head position unknown), c. 6 m long. The wood had disintegrated, but the impression made by the boat could be traced and many boat rivets were found. In the boat the disturbed remains of seven individuals (sex unknown 13-17, female 18-25 and 36-45, and male 13-17, 18-25, 26-35, 36-45) and a dog were found. Grave-goods: thirty beads, silver Thor´s hammer, copper alloy bell, fragment of Cufic coin (a dirhem, probably c. 870-930 AD.), pendant, copper alloy chain, copper alloy pin, small piece of lead with inlaid cross, two arm-rings, finger-ring, two combs, fragment of a third and fragments of a comb-case, fourteen lead weights, small wooden pin, knife, perforated white pebble, round perforated piece of bone and fragments of copper alloy and iron.    Þór Magnússon suggests that this was originally a woman’s grave, with the bones of the other individuals being added later.    2. The disturbed remains of another burial were found twelve metres SE of the boat grave. This was a small stone cist, made of two rows of stones, c. 180 x 50cm. No human bones were found.

The wood had disintegrated, but the impression made by the boat could be traced and many boat rivets were found. In the boat the disturbed remains of seven individuals (sex unknown 13-17, female 18-25 and 36-45, and male 13-17, 18-25, 26-35, 36-45) and a dog were found. Grave-goods: thirty beads, silver Thor´s hammer, copper alloy bell, fragment of Cufic coin (a dirhem, probably c. 870-930 AD.), pendant, copper alloy chain, copper alloy pin, small piece of lead with inlaid cross, two arm-rings, finger-ring, two combs, fragment of a third and fragments of a comb-case, fourteen lead weights, small wooden pin, knife, perforated white pebble, round perforated piece of bone and fragments of copper alloy and iron.    Þór Magnússon suggests that this was originally a woman’s grave, with the bones of the other individuals being added later.    2. The disturbed remains of another burial were found twelve metres SE of the boat grave. This was a small stone cist, made of two rows of stones, c. 180 x 50cm. No human bones were found. Grave-goods: whetstone and horse tooth. Two more horse teeth and the tooth of a pig were found close by.

In the boat the disturbed remains of seven individuals (sex unknown 13-17, female 18-25 and 36-45, and male 13-17, 18-25, 26-35, 36-45) and a dog were found. Grave-goods: thirty beads, silver Thor´s hammer, copper alloy bell, fragment of Cufic coin (a dirhem, probably c. 870-930 AD.), pendant, copper alloy chain, copper alloy pin, small piece of lead with inlaid cross, two arm-rings, finger-ring, two combs, fragment of a third and fragments of a comb-case, fourteen lead weights, small wooden pin, knife, perforated white pebble, round perforated piece of bone and fragments of copper alloy and iron.    Þór Magnússon suggests that this was originally a woman’s grave, with the bones of the other individuals being added later.    2. The disturbed remains of another burial were found twelve metres SE of the boat grave. This was a small stone cist, made of two rows of stones, c. 180 x 50cm. No human bones were found. Grave-goods: whetstone and horse tooth. Two more horse teeth and the tooth of a pig were found close by.

Kumlaleifar rannsakaði ég á Hrollaugsstöðum sumarið 1952. Þær voru í tveimur stöðum í landareigninni. Aðrar leifarnar voru í nýræktarflagi uppi undir hömrum fyrir utan og ofan bæinn. Hafði þar áður verið hrísmór en var bylt með jarðýtu. Þarna fundust nokkur beinabrot, sem jarðýtan hafði fært úr stað, m.a. mikið úr hauskúpu. Enn fleiri bein fundust, en engir gripir, og sýnilega hefur kumlinu verið umturnað fyrir löngu. Beinin eru sennilega úr konu.    Hinar leifarnar voru fyrir sunnan og ofan bæinn, uppi á hamrabeltinu sem bærinn stendur undir, „uppi á hraungarðinum“, eins og komist er að orði á bænum. Þarna eru miklir og allstórþýfðir móar (000. mynd). Flag hafði myndast þar í kolli stórrar þúfu, og grófu leiksveinar í það, en komu niður á mannabein og hættu við það greftinum. Ég víkkaði út holu drengjanna og sá brátt að þetta mundi vera áður uppgrafið kuml, því að mannabeinahrafl var þar sundurlaust og innan um beinin nokkur hrossbein og hundsbein. Auk þessa fann ég, þó einkum á botni grafarinnar, nokkur járnbrot (Þjms. 15228) sem vant er að sjá úr hverju eru, en eitt þeirra gæti verið úr skjaldarbólu.    Hin upprunalega gröf tel ég að hafi komið skýrt fram þegar búið var að grafa innan úr henni hreyfðan jarðveg. Hún sneri A-V, en ógerningur að segja í hvorum endanum höfuðið hafði verið. Dýpt var um 75 sm, lengd 1,75 m og breidd um 90 sm. Sýnilega hefur verið orpinn lágur haugur yfir gröfina. Um 3 m frá vesturenda hennar var allstór þúfa og fremur í stærra lagi þeirra er þarna voru. Í hana gróf ég og fann hrossbein óskipuleg, og virðast þau sýna að þarna hafi verið hrossgröfin sem kumlinu fylgdi, og þessi hafi verið afstaðan milli kumla manns og hests. Í aðra stóra þúfu gróf ég einnig og fann eitt hrossbein, samhengislaust við allt annað.    Þessar leifar á Hrollaugsstöðum eru gott dæmi um mjög illa leikið kuml. Þar er allt úr lagi fært af fyrri manna höndum. Vel má vera að þarna í móunum séu fleiri slíkar minjar, en vandi að ætlast á hvar líklegast er.

Sumarið 1962 fannst lítið spjót (Þjms. 1962:125) hjá uppblásnum beinum norðan við tóftir Gömlu Grímsstaða á Hólsfjöllum. Á þessum slóðum höfðu bein og gripir sést áður (Þjms. 15222). Gerði Þorkell Grímsson þar rannsókn í ágúst sama ár.    Reyndust þarna vera leifar af örfoka kumli, sunnan við stórt rofabarð, á háum og ávölum mel norðan bæjartóftanna og um 64 m frá vegi.    Ofan á kumlinu lá dálítið af grjóti og þar fundust nokkur bein. Kumlið virðist hafa verið látið snúa N-S, en það var mjög skemmt og því erfitt að segja nánar til um umbúnað þess eða gerð. Eina haugféð sem fannst var áðunefnt spjót. Það er 16,9 sm langt, mest breidd um 2,2 sm og líklega af K-gerð.    Jón Steffensen skoðaði beinin og áleit að þrír einstaklingar hafi verið heygðir í kumlinu, þ.e. um 12 ára gamalt barn og ungur maður en kyn þeirra óvíst, og loks einn fullorðinn sem gæti hafa verið kona. Hildur Gestsdóttir telur hins vegar að beinin séu einungis úr tveimur einstaklingum, 7-12 ára barni og fullorðnum, kyn óvíst.

Um 185 m norðaustan við túnið í Hemlu er hóll sem heitir Norðastihóll eða Grýluhóll. Var fyrrum allmikill og samfelldur en er nú uppblásinn og rofinn víða. Á hólnum hafa fundist tvö kuml, 1932 og 1937, og voru bæði allmjög blásin. Matthías Þórðarson rannsakaði bæði kumlin.     1. kuml. Fyrra kumlið var í lægð norðaustan við hólstrýtuna og svo blásið að illt var að greina lögun þess. Grjótlaust virðist það hafa verið. Í því var beinagrind úr unglingspilti. Hann hafði legið á hægri hlið en hallast nokkuð aftur á bakið. Fætur vissu í norður, höfuð í suður. Dálítið krepptur um hné og mjaðmir. Vinstri handleggur og hönd höfðu legið niður yfir síðu og mjöðm. - Um 1 m norður frá fótum mannsins var beinagrind úr hesti og 2-3 m suðaustan við hann enn önnur. Báðar munu vera úr hestum, er heygðir hafa verið með manninum. Haugfé (000. mynd):         11328. Spjót, K-gerð, Sverd 21, 39 sm að l., lá hjá fótleggjum mannsins. 11329.

Smáhlutirnir 11332-37 (þó ekki 11336) lágu allir í beltisstað og munu hafa verið í pússi mannsins. Við belti hafði hnífurinn og verið.         11339. Járnmél með hringum.     11340. Gjarðarhringja. - 11339-40 fundust með nyrðri hestinum.     11341. Brot af hringjum og nöglum úr söðli, fundust hjá hinum hestinum. 11342. Járnmolar og ryðkekkir, ókennilegir.         Um 1 m austur frá syðri hrossbeinunum fannst dálítið brot af skeifu (Þjms. 11343), sem virðist munu hafa verið fjórboruð og fremur veigalítil. Þessa skeifu taldi Matthías Þórðarson til kumlsins, en varla fær það staðist, svo sem að er vikið síðar (bls. 000).    2. kuml. Síðara kumlið var litlu sunnar, í annarri lægð á hólnum. Í því var beinagrind heil, en svo fúin að beinin urðu ekki hirt. Gröfin hafði snúið A-V, höfuð í vesturenda. Umhverfis beinagrindina vottaði glöggt fyrir því að líkið hafði verið jarðað í kistu, 1,70 m að l., 40 sm að br., jafnvíðri í báða enda. Líkið hafði verið lagt á bakið, en þó meira á hægri hlið, andliti og tám snúið til suðurs og fætur dálítið krepptir um hnén. Leit helst út fyrir að kistan hefði verið ívið of þröng á alla vegu. Hendur lágu saman niður yfir kviðinn. Engir naglar fundust.     Um 1950 fundust enn forngripir á Grýluhól, brýni og koparlykill, sem líklega eru einnig úr uppblásnu kumli.

Í júlí 1951 rannsakaði ég stað þar sem Jónas bóndi Magnússon á Strandarhöfði hafði fundið beinaleifar við jarðýtuvinnu í flagi. Beinin fundust þar sem heitir Markhóll, rétt á bakka Fljótsvegar, 4-500 m frá bænum, milli hans og Strandarhjáleigu. Jarðvegur var sandur og mold, engir steinar, enda grjótlaust í Landeyjum, en í 1 m dýpt hreinn sjávarsandur. Mannabeinin voru sýnilega úr lagi færð fyrir löngu og lágu því mjög óreglulega. Við rannsóknina sást þó að þarna hafði verið tekin gröf, um 1,70 m að l., 70 sm að br. og um 90 sm djúp aftast, en grafarbotni hallaði mikið upp frá fótaenda. Gröfin sneri A-V, og hafði höfuð mannsins verið í vesturenda. Það sást af fótabeinum í austurenda grafar, og voru þau ein óhreyfð beinanna. Þar var og einn lítill járnmoli ókennilegur og tréleifar með. Annað fannst ekki. Staðurinn er eðlilegur fornaldarkumli, og járnmolinn með tréleifunum bendir fremur til að eitthvað gripakyns hafi verið í gröfinni. Því er hún hér í kumlatali.

Árið 1940 urðu vegagerðarmenn varir mannsbeinagrindar í Dufþaksholti, rétt fyrir sunnan gamlan túngarð, suður undan hliði sem þar er á honum. Hafði þarna verið dálítil þúst eða upphækkun.

Nálægt fótum varð vart lítilla, ryðþrunginna tréleifa. Beinin voru um 30-40 sm í jörðu og allmjög fúin. Haugfé var ekkert, og vantar því fullnaðarsönnun þess að kumlið sé fornt, en af öllum svip legstaðarins virtist rannsóknarmanninum að svo mundi vera. Beinin eru úr ungum karlmanni.

Þar finnst enn í sandinum mikið af beinum, bæði nauta, hrossa, sauða og jafnvel svína og vorið 1860 fann ég í hól þeim, er suður er örskammt frá bæjarstæðinu næst Þröngá og austan við svonefnda Grautarlág, mannsbein blásin út úr rofi vestan í hólnum; það voru fót- og lærleggir, viðlíka stórir og meðalmanns þessa tíma, og höfðu fætur legið til suðvesturs; ekki fann ég fleiri bein, en ég var líka áhaldalaus að grafa þar nokkuð til.“     Sigurður Vigfússon kom að Kápu 1883 en gerði enga rannsókn: „Fann ég þar ýmsa hluti forna, enda af málmi, mannabein, hundabein, mikið af hrossbeinum víða og nautsbein.“ Sigurður hafði með sér til safnsins nokkrar hrosstennur (2434) og fáein mannabein (2435) sem Jón Steffensen telur helst vera úr konu.    Vorið 1925 var athygli vakin á leifum kumlateigs þess er verið hefur á þessum stað, og rannsakaði Matthías Þórðarson þær samsumars. Hann fann þar kuml manns og hests. Þau voru í miklum halla, og höfðu vindur og vatn unnið þeim mikið tjón. Grjótið úr kumlunum hafði oltið frá að miklu leyti og lá í dreif niður frá þeim (000. mynd). Aðrar grjótdreifar fáum metrum austar og vestar sýndu að þarna höfðu verið fleiri kuml, en þau voru örfoka. Rétt fyrir síðastliðin aldamót fann smali tvær hauskúpur á aurunum fyrir neðan þessar kumlaleifar, og hafa þær oltið undan halla fram úr kumlunum. Í kumli því er Matthías Þórðarson rannsakaði voru leifar af beinum úr gömlum karlmanni. Höfuð hans var í norðurenda grafarinnar, og hefur hann því hvílt álíka og beinagrind sú sem Páll Sigurðsson sá. Matthíasi Þórðarsyni virtist lega beinanna benda til að líkið hefði setið í haugnum og horft undan brekkunni móti suðri. Þessari ályktun verður að taka með varúð, því að kumlið var illa leikið af náttúrunnar völdum. - Vinstra megin við mannskumlið var heygður hestur, og vissi höfuð hans að manninum. Hafði hann verið lagður á kviðinn í kumlið. Af tönnum varð ráðið að hesturinn hefði verið um tvítugt er hann var drepinn. Haugfé var sem hér greinir:        9089. a-c. Þrír silfurhnappar af klæðum mannsins, brugðnir úr grönnum silfurþræði, uppmjókkandi.     9090. Gullþræðir mjög smágerðir, undnir upp í gorma og hafa verið spunnir um grófari þráð.     9091. Spjót mikið af K-gerð, Sverd 21, 54 sm að l., var í hrosskumlinu, en á vitanlega við mannskumlið. Spjótið hefur því verið við vinstri hlið mannsins (mynd af því er í Árbók 1925-26, bls. 50).     9092. Viðarkolamolar sem munu hafa verið látnir af ásettu ráði í gröfina.    9094-9103. Tvær járnhringjur, 7 járnkengir með tréleifum, þrjár járndoppur, margir ókennilegir járnkekkir. Allir þessir hlutir eru úr reiðtygjum, líklega flestir úr söðli. Á tönnum hestsins sást spanskgræna, svo að eitthvað bronskyns hefur verið á beisli því er uppi í honum var, en af því fannst ekkert.         Frá sama stað, en varla úr sama kumli, bárust safninu eftirtaldir smáhlutir 1934:         11556. Gullhnappur eða smásveigur gerður á líkan hátt og silfurhnappar þeir er fyrr getur.     11557. Hringja úr bronsi, 2 sm að br., með tveimur litlum eyrum aftast til að festa við ól, en að framan er hún mótuð sem dýrstrýni í Borróstíl.     11558. Blýmet, í lögun sem stýfð keila, 5.903 g að þyngd.    Að lokum má nefna að Þórður Tómasson segir að mannshauskúpa hafi fundist skammt frá Grautarlág um 1910.

Þau voru í miklum halla, og höfðu vindur og vatn unnið þeim mikið tjón. Grjótið úr kumlunum hafði oltið frá að miklu leyti og lá í dreif niður frá þeim (000. mynd). Aðrar grjótdreifar fáum metrum austar og vestar sýndu að þarna höfðu verið fleiri kuml, en þau voru örfoka. Rétt fyrir síðastliðin aldamót fann smali tvær hauskúpur á aurunum fyrir neðan þessar kumlaleifar, og hafa þær oltið undan halla fram úr kumlunum. Í kumli því er Matthías Þórðarson rannsakaði voru leifar af beinum úr gömlum karlmanni. Höfuð hans var í norðurenda grafarinnar, og hefur hann því hvílt álíka og beinagrind sú sem Páll Sigurðsson sá. Matthíasi Þórðarsyni virtist lega beinanna benda til að líkið hefði setið í haugnum og horft undan brekkunni móti suðri.

Hafði hann verið lagður á kviðinn í kumlið. Af tönnum varð ráðið að hesturinn hefði verið um tvítugt er hann var drepinn. Haugfé var sem hér greinir:        9089. a-c. Þrír silfurhnappar af klæðum mannsins, brugðnir úr grönnum silfurþræði, uppmjókkandi.     9090. Gullþræðir mjög smágerðir, undnir upp í gorma og hafa verið spunnir um grófari þráð.     9091. Spjót mikið af K-gerð, Sverd 21, 54 sm að l., var í hrosskumlinu, en á vitanlega við mannskumlið. Spjótið hefur því verið við vinstri hlið mannsins (mynd af því er í Árbók 1925-26, bls. 50).     9092. Viðarkolamolar sem munu hafa verið látnir af ásettu ráði í gröfina.    9094-9103. Tvær járnhringjur, 7 járnkengir með tréleifum, þrjár járndoppur, margir ókennilegir járnkekkir. Allir þessir hlutir eru úr reiðtygjum, líklega flestir úr söðli. Á tönnum hestsins sást spanskgræna, svo að eitthvað bronskyns hefur verið á beisli því er uppi í honum var, en af því fannst ekkert.         Frá sama stað, en varla úr sama kumli, bárust safninu eftirtaldir smáhlutir 1934:         11556. Gullhnappur eða smásveigur gerður á líkan hátt og silfurhnappar þeir er fyrr getur.     11557. Hringja úr bronsi, 2 sm að br., með tveimur litlum eyrum aftast til að festa við ól, en að framan er hún mótuð sem dýrstrýni í Borróstíl.     11558. Blýmet, í lögun sem stýfð keila, 5.903 g að þyngd.    Að lokum má nefna að Þórður Tómasson segir að mannshauskúpa hafi fundist skammt frá Grautarlág um 1910.

Matthíasi Þórðarsyni virtist lega beinanna benda til að líkið hefði setið í haugnum og horft undan brekkunni móti suðri. Þessari ályktun verður að taka með varúð, því að kumlið var illa leikið af náttúrunnar völdum. - Vinstra megin við mannskumlið var heygður hestur, og vissi höfuð hans að manninum. Hafði hann verið lagður á kviðinn í kumlið. Af tönnum varð ráðið að hesturinn hefði verið um tvítugt er hann var drepinn. Haugfé var sem hér greinir:        9089. a-c. Þrír silfurhnappar af klæðum mannsins, brugðnir úr grönnum silfurþræði, uppmjókkandi.     9090. Gullþræðir mjög smágerðir, undnir upp í gorma og hafa verið spunnir um grófari þráð.     9091. Spjót mikið af K-gerð, Sverd 21, 54 sm að l., var í hrosskumlinu, en á vitanlega við mannskumlið. Spjótið hefur því verið við vinstri hlið mannsins (mynd af því er í Árbók 1925-26, bls. 50).     9092. Viðarkolamolar sem munu hafa verið látnir af ásettu ráði í gröfina.    9094-9103. Tvær járnhringjur, 7 járnkengir með tréleifum, þrjár járndoppur, margir ókennilegir járnkekkir. Allir þessir hlutir eru úr reiðtygjum, líklega flestir úr söðli. Á tönnum hestsins sást spanskgræna, svo að eitthvað bronskyns hefur verið á beisli því er uppi í honum var, en af því fannst ekkert.         Frá sama stað, en varla úr sama kumli, bárust safninu eftirtaldir smáhlutir 1934:         11556. Gullhnappur eða smásveigur gerður á líkan hátt og silfurhnappar þeir er fyrr getur.     11557. Hringja úr bronsi, 2 sm að br., með tveimur litlum eyrum aftast til að festa við ól, en að framan er hún mótuð sem dýrstrýni í Borróstíl.     11558. Blýmet, í lögun sem stýfð keila, 5.903 g að þyngd.    Að lokum má nefna að Þórður Tómasson segir að mannshauskúpa hafi fundist skammt frá Grautarlág um 1910. Þórður skoðaði kumlateiginn fyrst sumarið 1935 og fann einna hrosstönn og brot úr hrosslegg við eitt kumlið.

Þá munu hafa fundist mannsbein (upphandleggsbein, kjálkar með jöxlum og tönnum og hryggurinn samhangandi) og þar rétt hjá vottaði fyrir rúst.

Í ágúst 1956 fannst kuml við malartöku vegna vegagerðar í Sæmundarhlíð. Möl var tekin úr Torfhól (Torfmelur) sem er stór melhóll um 200 m suður og niður frá Sólheimum. Kristján Eldjárn gerði athugun á staðnum og fann leifar tveggja kumla. Fyrra kumlinu lýsir hann svo:     1. kuml. Kumlið, sem vegagerðarmennirnir fundu, hafði verið vestarlega á hólnum. Um það er ekki annað vitað en að þarna höfðu verið grafnir maður og hestur. Ekkert haugfé fannst og er líklegt að kumlið hafi verið rænt. Jón Steffensen athugaði beinaleifarnar og áleit þær vera úr miðaldra karlmanni. Hildur Gestsdóttir hefur endurskoðað greiningu beinanna og telur einnig mögulegt að þau sér úr karlmanni en að ekki verði sagt um aldur hans.    2. kuml. Um 35 m ASA frá 1. kumli var gróin þúst sem við nánari athugun reyndist einnig vera kuml. Við gröft í þústina kom í ljós að allmikið var af hnullungagrjóti og þar undir gröf sem sneri N-S, um 2 m löng og 1 m breið og hafði verið grafin um 30 sm ofan í melinn. Í henni fundust fáein mannabein og hrossbein en engir gripir. Kristján telur að líkið hafi legið með höfuð í norður en fætur í suður, því að við suðurendann fannst hrossgröf, óreglulega kringlótt, um 120-135 sm í þvm., og var um 45 sm haft á milli grafanna.     Í hrossgröfinni fundust nokkur bein, sum hreyfð. Nokkur fótbein voru óhreyfð og af þeim mátti sjá að haus hestsins hefur snúið í suður. Haugfé í hrossgröfinni var sem hér segir:         Gjarðarhringja, 5,7x6,8 sm, lá óhreyfð við fótbeinin úr hestinum.     Rónagli, 3 sm að lengd, eflaust úr söðli.    6 lítil og óskilgreinanleg járnbrot, líklega úr söðli.        Jón Steffensen skoðaði þau fáu varðveittu mannabein sem fundust í þessu kumli og áleit þau vera úr fulltíða karlmanni, en Hildur Gestsdóttir telur að ekki sé unnt að greina þau til kyns eða aldurs.        3. kuml. Kristján greindi frá 1. og 2. kumli í skýrslu sem hann birti 1958. Síðan þá hafa enn fundist mannabein á Torfhól og ljóst að þar eru leifar af kumlateig: Haustið 1968 var á ný tekin möl úr hólnum til vegagerðar, en beinin komu ekki í ljós fyrr en mölinni var sturtað á veginn. Samkvæmt óprentaðri skýrslu Þórs Magnússonar um beinafundi í Sæmundarhlíð virtust þessar beinaleifar illa varðveittar og fundarstaðnum svo raskað að ekki væri vert að gera þar frekari rannsókn.

Um 35 m ASA frá 1. kumli var gróin þúst sem við nánari athugun reyndist einnig vera kuml. Við gröft í þústina kom í ljós að allmikið var af hnullungagrjóti og þar undir gröf sem sneri N-S, um 2 m löng og 1 m breið og hafði verið grafin um 30 sm ofan í melinn. Í henni fundust fáein mannabein og hrossbein en engir gripir. Kristján telur að líkið hafi legið með höfuð í norður en fætur í suður, því að við suðurendann fannst hrossgröf, óreglulega kringlótt, um 120-135 sm í þvm., og var um 45 sm haft á milli grafanna.     Í hrossgröfinni fundust nokkur bein, sum hreyfð. Nokkur fótbein voru óhreyfð og af þeim mátti sjá að haus hestsins hefur snúið í suður. Haugfé í hrossgröfinni var sem hér segir:         Gjarðarhringja, 5,7x6,8 sm, lá óhreyfð við fótbeinin úr hestinum.     Rónagli, 3 sm að lengd, eflaust úr söðli.    6 lítil og óskilgreinanleg járnbrot, líklega úr söðli.        Jón Steffensen skoðaði þau fáu varðveittu mannabein sem fundust í þessu kumli og áleit þau vera úr fulltíða karlmanni, en Hildur Gestsdóttir telur að ekki sé unnt að greina þau til kyns eða aldurs.        3. kuml. Kristján greindi frá 1. og 2. kumli í skýrslu sem hann birti 1958. Síðan þá hafa enn fundist mannabein á Torfhól og ljóst að þar eru leifar af kumlateig: Haustið 1968 var á ný tekin möl úr hólnum til vegagerðar, en beinin komu ekki í ljós fyrr en mölinni var sturtað á veginn. Samkvæmt óprentaðri skýrslu Þórs Magnússonar um beinafundi í Sæmundarhlíð virtust þessar beinaleifar illa varðveittar og fundarstaðnum svo raskað að ekki væri vert að gera þar frekari rannsókn.

Allstórum og bröttum hól fyrir sunnan og ofan bæinn, utan gamla túngarðsins, hafði verið bylt með jarðýtu og megninu af moldinni steypt ofan í lægð sem framan undir hólnum var. Þegar búið var að umturna hólnum fundust mörg mannabein hér og hvar í moldinni. Voru þau tínd saman og grafin í holu, en lítið eftir leitað. Bóndinn sagðist hafa séð botna undan tveimur gröfum sem báðar hefðu verið höggnar lítið eitt niður í móhelluna sem í hólnum var. Þær sneru N-S, en annars var ekki tekið eftir neinu um leg eða horf. Kartöflugarður fullsprottinn var um allt kumlstæðið, þegar ég kom þar, svo að rannsókn varð ekki við komið. En líklegt er að meira mætti finna af sundurlausu beinahrafli. Lét ég nægja að hirða það sem bóndi hafði tínt saman.    Að sögn Jóns Steffensens eru bein þessi úr þremur mönnum, einum miðaldra karlmanni, einni fullvaxinni konu og líklega annarri fullvaxinni konu. Eitt hrossbein var meðal þessara beina, en annars varð bóndi ekki slíks var. Af haugfé fann hann ekki annað en öxi (Þjms. 15235) af G-gerð, Sverd 38, granna og rýra, 14 sm að lengd, og brýni (Þjms. 15236) brotið, 12 sm að lengd, mikið brýnt.

Skansinn í Vestmannaeyjum er í landi Kornhóls, sem áður mun hafa heitið Höfn. Bærinn stóð í túninu austan við Skansinn en var eyðilagður þegar virkið var reist.    1. kuml. Árið 1968 komu í ljós leifar af kumli austan við Skansinn. Gísli Gestsson gerði þar rannsókn í júlí sama ár. Var kumlið mjög skemmt af völdum skurðgraftar og flest beinin færð úr stað. Þar fundust mannsbein, hnífur og spjótsfalur. Hildur Gestsdóttir hefur rannsakað beinin og telur þau vera úr karlmanni um fimmtugt eða eldri.     2. kuml. Árið 1992 fundust enn mannabein við Skansinn er unnið var þar með vélgröfu. Mjöll Snæsdóttir rannsakaði staðinn sama ár. Þar kom í ljós gröf á um 1,20 m dýpi. Af þeim hluta grafarinnar sem var óraskaður mátti sjá að hún hafði verið um 50-60 sm djúp og snúið austur-vestur, með höfuð í vesturenda. Gröfin hafði verið tekin í gegnum landnámslagið og annað gjóskulag yngra. Haugfé:        Armbaugur, snúinn saman úr tveim þáttum, annar úr bronsi en hinn úr silfri.    Tvö brot úr beinkambi.; Tveir steinar (eldtinnur?).; Steinn, glerhallur.; Brot úr skærum.; Nagli úr járni.         Hildur Gestsdóttir telur líklegt að beinin séu úr konu en aldur verður ekki ákvarðaður.
